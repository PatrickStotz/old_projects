What this project is about
--------------
The goal of this project is to produce strong visuals that help to raise awareness for the accessibility of public transport.To achieve this, we've remapped the public transit networks of Hamburg, London and New York by simply erasing every station name from the map where the corresponding station is not accessible.  
The information about each stations' accessibility is derived from official maps by the responsible operator (Status 02/2014). To avoid copyright issues the remapping itself is based on open licensed transport maps.

***Please note that the purpose of our maps is not to actually guide someone. There certainly is more up-to-date and more detailed information available about the accessibility of every station. It's more about making accessibility matters easily comprehensible.***

Realization
--------------
If you want to produce a map like this for your own city, go ahead. It's pretty simple. There's a simple description in our blog post about the project: [mappable.info/blog/2014/2/8/accessibility](http://mappable.info/blog/2014/2/8/accessibility). In the end it's just two images been put on top of each other with [jQeury twentytwenty](https://github.com/zurb/twentytwenty) as a visual diff slider to swipe between the two of them.
